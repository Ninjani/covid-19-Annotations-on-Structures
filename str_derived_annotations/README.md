Extract and visualize structure-derived annotations from (sets of) PDB IDs.

Dependencies
* `numpy`
* `prody`
* `matplotlib`
* `dataclasses`


For a set of related PDB IDs (e.g. same protein crystallized with different ligands)
* RMSD of each structure to the reference structure (first PDB ID in list)
* Average RMSD of each residue across all structures
* Squared fluctuations of each residue according to a PCA across all structures

For a single PDB ID, predict (according to elastic network models)
* Residue fluctuations
* Perturbation response
  * Effectiveness of each residue in perturbing other residues
  * Sensitivity of each residue to perturbation
* Mechanical stiffness
* Relative solvent accessibility
* Hinge sites connecting two stretches of structure that may move independently

These annotations can be written out as structure annotation and visualized in the beta SWISS-MODEL annotation website (see `example_usage.py` and the annotations folder for examples).
